# Hive design system tokens

Hive is a design system created for SinchSMB and child products. This repository contains design tokens generated using [Figma Tokens](https://docs.tokens.studio) plugin from [Hive design file](https://www.figma.com/file/ba5gOeZ2Bb2EPFF0gAlDM5/%F0%9F%90%9D-Hive).

## Themes
Themes generated on the tokens base are placed in the `./themes` directory.

### Theme generation

Themes files are generated automatically via GitHub workflows.
But you can use the `npm run build` command to create them manually.
